## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
According to the model results, vehicle length (vehicle_weight) and ground clesrance (ground_clearance) are statistically unlikely to provide a random amount of variance to the linear model. 
The slope of the linear model is not zero - at 0.715 there is correlation between variables.
This model somewhat predicts mpg of prototypes. There are some variables tested that move rnadomly with mpg that can maybe be discarded while other variables could be tested to make the model more robust.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
The current amnufacturing data meets the 100 psi spec when considering the whole lot. When we drill down into the individual lots however, the data vary. With a variance measure of 170.26 Lot 3 does not comply with that specificiation.
